Rabbit Proto makes plugins that easily integrate into your 3D printer, enabling it to print complex conductive traces within 3D designs.  Your 3D printer can now print interactive prototypes with capacitive and conductive features.

Rabbit Proto has been created for designers and makers - they can now speed up their prototyping and ideation process, going from computer design to interactive prototype with just one click.

Rabbit Proto is a print head add-on that easily plugs into your 3D printer, enabling it to print complex conductive traces within your 3D design. The project source code, documentation, and example designs are open source and available on GitHub.
